These are the sources for the website of the Tel Aviv Perl Mongers:

All templates reside in the "templates" folder. The list of events is in Haml
form in the "templates/events.haml" file. The previous events template
(previous.tt) is creates from a Perl script (bin/render_events.pl).

You'll need Template (Template::Toolkit), IO::All and Text::Haml.

Once updated, simply run:

    $ ./bin/create.sh

What's index.old.html:

A piece of history. :)
It is kept as a reminder of the old website.
