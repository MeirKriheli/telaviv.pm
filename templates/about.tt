      <h2>About Perl Mongers</h2>
      <p class="grey">
        The Perl Mongers are a local group of (mostly, but not necessarily) Perl programmers who meet every month.<br/>
        There is no registry of members, and anyone can come to any meeting. If you have the time, stop by!
      </p>
      <h2>Meetings</h2>
      <p class="grey">
        All meetings organized by TA.pm are completely <strong>100% free-of-charge</strong>, and <strong>everyone</strong> is invited.<br/>
        Anyone can give talks on almost any subject, while Perl-related subjects are obviously more recommended. :)<br/>
        If you feel like giving a talk, contact the general Israel <a href="http://mail.perl.org.il/mailman/listinfo/perl/"><em>perl@perl.org.il</em></a> mailing list, or contact <a href="mailto:xsawyerx ATT cpan DOTT org"><em>Sawyer X</em></a> directly.
      </p>

      <p>The meetings are suitable for beginners, intermediates and advanced!</p>
