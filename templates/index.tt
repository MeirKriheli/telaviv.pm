                            <p>Our next meeting will be held on Wednesday, 27 November 2013!<br/>
                            <b>Shenkar College Building in Anna Frank St., Ramat Gan</b><br/>
                            <b>Room 247 (previously known as room 407)</b></p>

                            <p>Ori Idan - Using Linux and Perl for Testing Hardware</p>

                            <p>Every electronic circuit must be checked before it is delivered to the
                            customer. The check should perform a functional test of all the circuitâ€™s
                            functions. In mass production, an automatic test is a must. In this talk, I
                            will talk about the implementation of some functional test systems which I have
                            implemented for several customers. All these systems use Linux as their
                            operating systems and Perl for the actual tests.</p>

                            <h3>Perl Mongers</h3>
                            <p>The group organizes social events centered around Perl in the greater Tel Aviv, Israel area. We have talks, lectures, and casual meetings. Come meet fellow Perl (and non-Perl) geeks, share a snack, and have some laughs!</p>
                            <p><strong>(The meetings are suitable for beginner, intermediate and advanced developers)</strong></p>
